        uint vestingCliff_
        uint vestingEnd_
    )
```

**Parameters**

- address recipient\_ - recipient's address
- uint amount\_ - amount that should be vested
- uint vestingBegin\_ - timestamp of the beginning of vesting
- uint vestingCliff\_ - timestamp of the end of the Cliff (since this moment tokens become available to claim)
- uint vestingEnd\_ - timestamp of the end of the vesting

### Claim Tokens

```jsx
function claim(address recipient_
```

_function to claim tokens_

## Getters

function getAvailableBalance(address recipient_) public view returns(uint)
```

_returns amount available to claim for user_
